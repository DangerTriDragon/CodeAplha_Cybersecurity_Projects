<h1>Cybersecurity Projects</h1>

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I showcase cybersecurity projects focused on threat detection, secure coding, and user awareness. These projects are designed to enhance security measures in various domains, including network defense, secure development, and social engineering prevention.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>2. Phishing Awareness Training</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A comprehensive training program designed to educate users about phishing attacks, how to recognize them, and best practices to avoid falling victim to such threats.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simulated phishing attacks to test user awareness.</li>
        <li>Interactive training modules covering phishing techniques.</li>
        <li>Reporting and analytics to track user performance.</li>
        <li>Real-world phishing examples for practical learning.</li>
    </ul>

 <h3>2. Secure Coding Review</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A tool designed to analyze Python code for security vulnerabilities, providing recommendations based on secure coding practices.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Static code analysis to detect vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Secure coding recommendations based on industry standards.</li>
        <li>Detailed reports highlighting security flaws and mitigation steps.</li>
        <li>Support for integrating with CI/CD pipelines.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, Bandit (security linter), Flake8, OWASP Secure Coding Guidelines</p>
    <h3>3. Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A system designed to monitor network traffic and detect malicious activity using signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Real-time network traffic analysis.</li>
        <li>Detection of common cyber threats (DDoS, port scanning, malware traffic, etc.).</li>
        <li>Alerting mechanism for suspicious activity.</li>
        <li>Log analysis and reporting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Snort,LOIC </p>
